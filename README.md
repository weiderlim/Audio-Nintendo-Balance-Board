# Final Year Project
My final year project at Imperial College London, where I was a Mechanical Engineering Undergraduate. This was my first exposure to Python. 

The objective of this script is to extract the input from a Nintendo Balance Board, which are the readings from 4 force plates located at the corners of the balance board, and to simultaneously output an audio signal to let the user know how off-balance he or she is from his or her centre.

The goal of the project was to find the relation between audio stimulus and a person's balance.
The purpose of the project is to find effect of different actions, like balancing on one leg, balancing with a weight etc on a  person's balance over time. This project was also conducted on people with different handicaps.

Hopefully further use and improvements to this script will be able to give users better balance when performing tasks, which would be especially useful for people with disabilities.

The set-up was code largely copied from other GitHub users who decoded the Bluetooth signals coming from the board. My modifications to the existing code was to combine the signals to give a user's balance over time and to output the corresponding audio output.
